# Horror Movie Night Curated

This is the official Horror Movie Night curation files - this is where the app pulls recommendations from. The movies, short films, and video games are personally curated by <a href="https://github.com/roncodes" target="_roncodes">Ronald A. Richardson</a>, but this repo allows the curation to become a community effort. Make a PR if you have a movie you'd like to add.
